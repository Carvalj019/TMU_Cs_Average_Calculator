This project was used to analyze data from a spreadsheet containing admission averages for people who recieved an offer for a 
program at different universities across Ontario. More specifically, this project collects the averages of those who got offers 
to TMU for Computer Ccience and computes the most optimal average to have when applying for Computer Science at TMU (for the 2021-2022 academic year only).
